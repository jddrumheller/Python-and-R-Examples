# Python and R Examples
 Some example statistics/data science projects in Python and R I've been working on.

* Mackerel Survey is an example adapted from S. Woods *Generalized Additive Models*. A GAM is used for spatial smoothing using the `pygam` library in Python.
* The sample size calculator is a simple program to compute sample sizes for four different types of tests. A simulation approach is used to computing sample size. It is intended as a somewhat contrived example of making and implementing a class in python.
* The Forest Cover shows some different plotting of a large data set using seaborn. A neural network is examined along with a sensitivity anaysis on each of the explanitory varibles to see which has the strongest effect on prediction accuracy.
* The Forest Fires analysis attempts to predict the size of forest fires using the XGBoost framework and LASSO regression.
